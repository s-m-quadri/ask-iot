<h1 align="center">Ask IoT v1.0</h1>

<p align="center">A Python-based command-line tool that leverages a custom implementation of the TF-IDF algorithm to provide interactive and concise three-point answers to IoT-related queries, making it a valuable resource for researchers and IoT enthusiasts.</p>

## I. Features

1. **TF-IDF-based Querying:** "ask_iot" uses the TF-IDF algorithm to process and analyze IoT-related data, allowing users to obtain relevant information based on their queries.

2. **Command-Line Interface:** The tool runs in a command-line interface (CLI), providing a straightforward and efficient way for users to interact with it.

3. **Looped Prompting:** "ask_iot" operates in a loop, continuously prompting users for queries and providing concise three-point answers, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience.

4. **Exit Command:** To terminate the tool, users can simply enter the command "exit", allowing for easy and controlled termination of the program.

5. **Open-Source and FOSS:** "ask_iot" is released as free and open-source software (FOSS), enabling others to view, use, modify, and contribute to the tool's development.

## II. Usage

1. Install the code from this repository.

2. Make sure python is installed on your system. Then install the dependencies by running:
	```bash
	python -m pip install nltk
	```
3. Then run the program using:
	```bash
